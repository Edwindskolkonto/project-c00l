                <p><strong>Adrians backstory</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Adrian’s tale begins in the aristocracy of Galdorweald, a kingdom of jagged peaks perched on the northwestern edge of the second continent. Within this realm of treacherous cliffs and mountains lay the wizarding capital, Wintrhelm, where Adrian spent his youth.
                </p>
                <h3>Prologue</h3>
                <p>
                    Though young compared to its neighbors, Galdorweald’s history is deep. Legend claims the nation was carved from the wilderness by a single archmage, whose name now is lost to all but the oldest family lines. The brittle peace the north now enjoys is a recent luxury; in ages past, the continent was a chaotic mosaic of warring states, each hungry for more land and power. Maps of that era were rendered obsolete in weeks. Borders bled into one another and names were rewritten in conquest, yet one region remained untouched by the chaos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The common folk called it the Accursed Woods, Its true name, Greenwinter, used by maps and scholars but seldom spoken by those who knew its shadowed paths. Throughout history, ambitious lords had tried to tame it, raising villages and outposts. Each attempt ended in failure, swallowed by the forest without a trace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The nobles, in their distant manors, blamed the frigid gales and bone-deep winter. Rangers and mountaineers knew better. They spoke of the true perils: the tangled, lightless forests, the poison-thorned flora, the deceptively swift rivers, and the gnawing scarcity of food. Others still whispered of the true inhabitants—the wildlife and abominations that lurked in the gloom, hunting the brave pioneers and the unwilling conscripts dragged there by overreaching rulers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the darkest rumors, those that slipped from the huddled villages clinging to the green edge of Greenwinter, murmured of an ancient taint bleeding from the Shadowfell. With knowledge a rare commodity in those times and proof a luxury, along with harrowing accounts by foolhardy adventurers braving the area, rumors were easily taken to heart. Though many dismissed the tales as rumor, they clung to the imagination, eventually branding the forest with its moniker the Accursed Woods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For countless years, the land remained untouched and unpopulated by mankind, a solitude broken only by the arrival of the first Archmage.
                </p>
                <h3>The Great Magi</h3>
                <p>
                    Where the arcane weaver hailed from and how he reached these lands, no one knew. One fateful day, some traveling merchants passing by Greenwinter met an old man leaning on a wooden staff. He had a long white beard, bushy eyebrows that stuck out from under his tall, pointed blue hat, and a long gray cloak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Travelers were few and far between in those times, with bandits being a common encounter on the roads. Most ordinary folk who traveled did so using a horse and carriage with hired guards, which made the encounter with a lone old man even stranger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The old man stood by the side of the road, gazing at the forest and running his fingers through his beard as if he were appraising the woods. The merchants, suspecting an ambush, did not stop to talk, yet one shouted, "Hey, old man, you must be far from home. I've got to warn you, this isn't a place for the elderly."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The old man pulled his gaze away from the forest for a moment to focus on the merchant and merely chuckled in an amused way without replying. The merchant scoffed and turned his attention back to the road. Before they got out of earshot, they heard the old man say to himself, "This might be the right place."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Years passed, and the old man's whereabouts remained a mystery. Then, a select few in the major cities—individuals with an undeniable aptitude for the arcane—received a strange letter. Its cryptic contents became the topic of whispered discussions among nobles, for no one had seen the messenger, and the very paper felt warm to the touch. Yet, out of sheer, unbridled curiosity, most of the chosen showed up at the designated meeting place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They found themselves before a magnificent, standalone gate near the nearest great city. It was carved from a single, impossibly smooth piece of stone, its outer rim etched with glowing, unreadable runes. What truly stole their breath, however, was the realization that this colossal archway had not been there the day before; it had simply appeared out of thin air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A half-hour past the appointed time, doubt began to fester. Some started to talk, a few were even on the verge of leaving, when a hooded figure stepped out of the crowd and shed his cloak. It was the same old man from years ago, now clad in robes of pure, shimmering white. He walked forward, then, with a casual gesture, rose into the air and floated within the archway, to the gasping amazement of the onlookers. Magic was a known art, but a rare one—mostly simple cantrips wielded by the clergy or ostracized individuals rumored to have ancient blood. This was something else entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wizard welcomed them and invited them to what he called his grand wizarding country—a place where they could live in peace, discover new magic, and teach it to a new generation. Many thought him quite mad until he tapped his staff on the gate. With a deep grinding sound, it slowly opened to reveal a mountaintop, overlooking the rambling, accursed woods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If you wish to partake," he said, "step through."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some chose to stay, but a brave few crossed the threshold. On the other side, they found themselves on a precipice, gazing down at a cursed forest, and were about to witness a display of power only spoken of in ancient legends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Archmage lifted his staff, and the sky above the Hexed Woods shattered. The air grew heavy, and what seemed to be stars tore loose from the heavens, plummeting toward the earth as great, burning meteors. The ground trembled with a deafening, continuous roar, as the land was pummeled by boulders powerful enough to crush a city. The very earth seemed to scream. The onlookers shielded their eyes from the blinding flashes of light, unable to comprehend the sheer scale of the destruction below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the dust settled, the forest was gone—a vast, smoking crater left in its place. The Archmage’s voice, a calm whisper, echoed through the mountains, "Observe."
                </p>
                <p>
                    He spoke a single word, and the ground in the crater began to writhe. It bubbled like a witch’s stew, and from the seething earth, great spires of stone and marble erupted, twisting and forming into towering walls, vast floors, and a majestic, impossibly grand castle. The entire capital of an unseen nation was born in moments, a city of polished stone where only a wasteland had been moments before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Archmage then waved his hand in a slow, deliberate arc. For a fleeting second, a shimmering, translucent bubble was visible as it enclosed the entire new city and the mountain. Instantly, the air grew warm and sweet, the cold mountain breeze lost its bite, and the world seemed to glow with a newfound vibrancy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Welcome," the Archmage said, his voice now rich with power, "to the new magic capital of Galdorweald. Welcome to Wintrhelm."
                </p>
                <h3>The Founding and Golden Age of Wintrhelm</h3>
                <p>
                    At the four cardinal points of the city, magnificent gates identical to the first were erected, each one a shimmering portal connecting Wintrhelm to the greatest cities in the neighboring countries. Through these gateways, great numbers of people migrated to the wondrous new capital that had appeared overnight, lured by promises of prosperity and the chance to live in a city of scholars. In just a few months, Wintrhelm—a new, prosperous city of arcane learning—was added to the continental maps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the rule of the first Archmage, the country of Galdorweald flourished. Minor cities soon blossomed throughout the once-accursed woods, each one connected to the capital by smaller, permanent gates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The heart of the new nation was the Great Wizarding College, a grand marvel of arcane architecture. From its highest tower, magic was taught to those with the proper aptitude, branching off into different schools of magic as the art evolved. At the college's core lay the Grand Library, a wonder that scholars from across the world would pilgrimage to for a chance to read its vast collection of tomes and drink from the very wellspring of knowledge. The Archmage’s chosen followers were granted unnaturally long lifespans, a testament to their unwavering faith and their dedication to teaching the arcane arts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mountain itself was a treasure, its depths rich with Veridium, a rare mineral that enhanced magical aptitude and channeling. The first Archmage's long and prosperous reign marked the country's Golden Age, but all good things must come to an end. Even the most powerful of mages are not immune to the ravages of time.
                </p>
                <h3>The Decline of the Archmages</h3>
                <p>
                    With the passing of the first Archmage, a new one was chosen to lead the school and guide the nation. Slowly but surely, the influence of the Archmages began to wane. The descendants of the chosen, now wealthy and arrogant, grew power-hungry. The Archmage's role diminished from a national leader to merely the Headmaster of the college, while the noble houses took control of the nation's political and economic affairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The great city of Wintrhelm slowly became divided into four distinct concentric circles, reflecting the new social order.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Fourth Circle, the outermost and largest, was a great expanse of fields, farmlands, and humble homes. It was here that the peasants and farmers lived, and where the roads from the four corner gates first entered the city.</li>
                    <li>The Third Circle was the bustling commercial district. Its streets were a labyrinth of shops and markets, with housing stacked on top. In later years, this was often the furthest anyone from the outside world could travel into the city.</li>
                    <li>The Second Circle was the domain of the nobility. Here, the descendants of the chosen houses built their lavish manors and ruled the nation. Their mandates were based on wealth, influence, and the power of their family name, not on magical skill.</li>
                    <li>The First Circle, at the very center, was where the Great Wizarding College stood in its entire, original splendor, a monument to a forgotten age.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    With the first Archmage gone, the magical protections began to slowly deteriorate. The polished surfaces of the city's walls started to erode, and the once-warm air grew cold again. The smaller gates connecting the outlying cities to the capital began to fail, one by one, leading to the eventual abandonment of the smaller settlements scattered throughout the land. The school itself began to show signs of age, a sad shadow of its former glory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was during this period of slow decay, shortly after the seventh Archmage was appointed, that our main man Adrian was born as the second child of the Darkthorn noble house.
